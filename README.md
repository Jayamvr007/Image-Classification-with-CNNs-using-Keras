# Image-Classification-with-CNNs-using-Keras
In this hands-on project , we will learn how to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Keras with a TensorFlow backend, and we will learn to train CNNs to solve Image Classification problems. In this project, we will create and train a CNN model on a subset of the popular CIFAR-10 dataset
